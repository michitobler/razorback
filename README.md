# Data and code for Gilbert et al. (submitted)

This repository includes data and code associated with Gilbert et al.: "Why is it too cold? Toward a mechanistic understanding of cold-water pollution on poor recruitment of an endangered fish":

- "RZB transcriptimes3.Rmd" includes code for all analyses for RNA-sequencing data
- "blast.x.results.human.csv" includes annotations of all genes in the razorback sucker genome based on a BLAST search against the human SwissProt database
- "coldata2.csv" includes all the metadata
- "gene_count_matrix_01July2022.csv" includes the read count matrix for all genes in the razorback sucker genome generated from RNA-sequencing data

Note that all custom scripts used for mapping and the generation of the read count matrix are available at: github.com/stevemussmann/dge_scripts
